Have you wanted to learn how to make app? Don't know how? Don't even know where to start? Well you've come to the right place!

Swift is a [top-tier programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/apples-swift-programming-language-is-now-top-tier/) created by Apple, to develop responsive and efficient mobile apps, server-side applications, and even macOS.

This workshop will go through a tour of Swift and cover how to make a unit converter iOS app.

Have you wanted to learn how to make app? Don't know how? Don't even know where to start? Well you've come to the right place!

Swift is a [top-tier programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/apples-swift-programming-language-is-now-top-tier/) created by Apple, to develop responsive and efficient mobile apps, server-side applications, and even macOS.

This workshop will go through a tour of Swift and cover how to make a unit converter iOS app.

Swift Structures has been optimized for **Swift 4.2** (e.g., Xcode 10.0) or later. The directories are organized as follows:
+ Source - Code for all Swift data structures, algorithms and source extensions

Since past Apple's keynote, where **SwiftUI** was announced, tons of docs, examples, videos and tutorials have appeared. The goal of this repository is to gather all this information having an unique place where looking for info about **SwiftUI**.

**SwiftUI** is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax that’s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. Automatic support for Dynamic Type, Dark Mode, localization, and accessibility means your first line of **SwiftUI** code is already the most powerful UI code you’ve ever written.
